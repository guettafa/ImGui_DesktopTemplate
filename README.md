# ImGui Desktop Template 
This template was made for multiple usage and can be cloned for hackathons or any other projects. It was built using __ImGui__ and __DirectX9__, making it compatible exclusively with Windows.

To compile this template, you'll need Visual Studio 2019 or later versions, with the __(Desktop development with C++)__ workload installed or with the __MSVC++__ module installed separately.
